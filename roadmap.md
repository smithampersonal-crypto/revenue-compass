# ARC Roadmap

## Phase 7 — Identity + Core Persistence Foundation

- [x] 7A Foundation: enums, tables, constraints, grants, RLS, trusted SECURITY DEFINER
      functions, generated types, database/security tests. draft → finalized →
      superseded lifecycle with `analyses.current_finalized_revision_id`.
- [x] 7A acceptance patch: least-privilege column grants on contracts/analyses/
      analysis_revisions, INSERT+UPDATE validation in the revision trigger, frozen
      ownership parents, pointer/supersession lineage triggers, lifecycle-shape check
      constraints, analyses row lock in finalization, adversarial privilege tests
      (`supabase/tests/phase7_privileges.sql`), service-role leakage test.
      **Awaiting review — do not start 7B until reviewed.**
- [x] 7B Identity: `/auth` sign-in (email magic link only — no passwords, no social
      login), `/auth/callback`, server-built callback URLs with ARC-local redirect
      validation (`ARC_SITE_URL` sets the deployed origin), verified-identity server
      function, `_authenticated` gate, `/workspace` + `/account`, session-aware
      header/account menu, bearer function middleware, root auth-state cache isolation
      (SIGNED_OUT and A→B identity change purge private cached data), dedicated
      duplicate-revision constraint test. Guest/sample use stays available without
      signing in. Google/social login is a future enhancement, not recruiter-ready v1.
      **Awaiting review — do not start 7C.** Open item for the project owner: run a live
      magic-link round trip once Supabase's development email quota resets
      (`over_email_send_rate_limit` is an infrastructure quota, not an ARC defect;
      custom SMTP is deferred to 7F).
- [ ] 7C Persistence in the workspace (DTOs, workspace/revision server functions,
      autosave, lock-version conflicts).
- [ ] 7D Finalization snapshot + Review & Finalize lifecycle + revision history
      (Superseded shown explicitly).
- [ ] 7E Guest workspace (9-hour, HttpOnly credential only) + atomic migration.
- [ ] 7F Hardening: account deletion, bundle/network service-role leakage audit,
      end-to-end regression, completion report.

## Standing guardrails

- No accounting engine or sample fixture change.
- Service-role imports server-only; routine CRUD caller-scoped through RLS.
- SECURITY DEFINER functions: fixed search_path, execute revoked from
  public/anon/authenticated, granted to service_role only.
- Samples never autosave. Browser-supplied engine outputs are never authoritative.
- `supabase/migrations/` is the reproducible source of truth.
- Phase 8 (documents/storage) not implemented.
